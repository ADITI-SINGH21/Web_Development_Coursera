<h1>Power of CSS </h1>

<p>Now, the collection of these CSS rules is what's called a style sheet. Now, technically speaking, you don't have to have anything in the style sheet to be called a style sheet. An empty style sheet, it technically is a style sheet as well. But it's just not a very useful one. So, obviously, you would have at least one CSS rule in there. But, typically, you have way more than just one. Okay, here I am in sublime text and I'm looking at a file called css-syntax.html and it's located in the examples/Lecture12 folder. Let me give you a quick rundown of the structure of the HTML that we have. So, in this HTML document we have a heading, h1, a couple of h2s, and a couple of paragraphs in between signified by the p paragraph tag. And what we'll want to do is give these elements some custom styling. So, I'm going to place the styling, our style sheet, straight in the head section of our HTML document. Now, in later lecture we'll talk about where CSS styles should really go for a real world website. But for now, for convenience sake, we'll just put it straight in the head part of the document. So, here we see a paragraph tag that's being targeted. And we're going to change it's color to blue, font size to 20, and width 200, which means it will contain an area of the screen that's 200 pixels wide. Our heading one tag, h1, we're going to give it a color of green, we'll bump up it's font size a little bit and we'll also tell it to align itself in the middle of the screen. So, let's take a look at what this page looks like in the browser.

<p>Well, that styling came from the browser itself. Every browser comes with some default styles that it applies to different HTML elements. And h1, h2, and so on, and different other elements are very commonly styled by the browser itself. So, a lot of the times it's your job to really reset, or override, these styles and put the styles in that you would like your webpage to have. So, to summarize, we went over the syntax of a CSS rule. We talked about the selector part, declaration part and the property value pair. We also talked about combining the CSS rules into one to create a style sheet. Next, we're going to zero in on the one part of the CSS rule declaration, and that is the selector. We're going to talk about different types of selectors. In particular, element, class and ID selectors.</p>
